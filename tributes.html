    <h2>Bessie Anderson's review on rent a pet</h2>
<p>My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.  I really wanted to have a small dog that I could take out for walks, but I though it was not possible.</p>  <p>Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try.  I found a  loveable bassett hound and met her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.</p>  <p>We went through a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time.  The great Rent A Pet staff came and picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about feeding or watering "Sophie".</p>  <p>We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits.  I know I look forward to getting in my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week,
Yours,Bessie Anderson</p>


      <h2>jason Hutchingson's review on rent a pet</h2>
<p>I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys.  I always wanted to have a large breed of dog that would be a companion to take running or play catch with in the park.</p>  <p>With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard.  He loves to run in the summer and even cross country ski in the winter.</p>  <p>The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course.  I always attract the attention of girls in the park when we go there.</p>  <p>I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away.  One day I will have a home where I can have a yard to keep my own dog.     Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.</p>  
<p>Thanks to Rent A Pet,Jason Hutchingson</p>
     
<h2>michael pinette's review on rent a pet </h2>
<p>My business requires me to travel quite a bit.  So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own.  I would have to constantly find someone to pet sit,</p> <p>or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.  I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets. Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my lifestyle.</p>  <p>I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.  I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep a house plant alive.</p>  <p>I can have fun with exotic pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy.</p>  <p>Thanks for adding spice to my life.

   <h2>melinda morrison's review on rent a pet</h2>
<p>As a young girl, I developed a love of horses.  But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.  I was delighted to find Rent A Pet.</p>  <p>They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels.  They will deliver the horse to the trail where I want to ride.</p> <p>Because I can request the same horse time after time, I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of the horse I ride.  I would never be able to provide room and board for my own animal.</p>
<p>Thanks for making a dream come true,Melinda Morrison</p>
