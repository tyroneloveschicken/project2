     <h1>about rent a pet</h1>

    <h2>history</h2>
   <p> In the Beginning ...
Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs.  
George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters.</p>  <p>These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.</p>  <p>One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women.</p>  <p>They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs.  A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk,</p> <p>but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep a large dog.  This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.</p>  <p>What if there were others, possible many others, who wanted companionship of pets without the responsibility?</p>  <p>Maybe people would be willing to pay to rent or borrow a pet for a short period of time.

<p>George shared his idea with Carol and they began to look at the pros and cons related to start a small business that would rent dogs for a day.</p>   <p>Some of the advantages of this kind of business would be:</p>
     <h2>advantages</h2><ul>
<li>Renters could have access to the pet at their leisure</li>
<li>Renters could pick the pet they wanted</li> 
<li>Renters could exercise with the pet</li>
<li>Renters could have companionship of a pet</li>
<li>Renters would not have to pay for upkeep or medical expenses</li>
<li>The owners could have many pets and enjoy them</li>
</ul> <h2>disadvantages</h2> <ul>
<li> of the disadvantages for this business would be:</li>
<li>business would need to take care of housing and feeding</li>
<li>The business would need to provide medical expenses</li>
<li>The business would need to have liability insurance </li>
<li>The owners would be tied down with the care of the pets></li>
</ul>
<h2>Where We are Today ...</h2> 
<p>After weighing these points, the Smiths decided to go ahead by starting small and in the fall of 1980 started Rent a Pet.  The business offered its customers the companionship of a pet without all the care of the extra expense or hassles of ownership.</p>  <p>They began with only providing dogs for rent.  Since the company's inception, Rent a Pet has extended their offerings by also adding cats, horses, pigs and snakes for rent.
</p>
<h2>What Makes Us Unique ...</h2><p>
Rent a Pet has expanded from its early location in Provo and now has franchises in Logan, Bountiful, Salt Lake City, and St. George.</p>  <p>They employ their own trained vet and have yet to have any accidents due to their rental pets.   Rent a Pet also employs an animal trainer who works with the dogs and horses daily.</p>

<p>Rent a Pet has attracted many satisfied customers.  The company frequently provides their services to senior citizens who reside in retirement homes that prohibit pet ownership.  A senior can enjoy a dog or cat for the day and even take them for a walk.</p>  <p>Surprisingly, young men looking to strike up a conversation with young women often rent dogs that like jogging or playing Frisbee.  Specially trained trick dogs can be rented for parties or appearances in movies or commercials.</p>  <p>The most unusual pet, snakes, are usually rented for Halloween or other occasions where the customer wants to use them for shock value.
